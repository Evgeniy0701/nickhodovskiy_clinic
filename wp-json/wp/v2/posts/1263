They are not very uncomfortable. Depending on the complexity of the disease, different mechanisms are used. They can be removable and fixed. The following types of constructions are distinguished:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"1\"><li>Braces are the most common model and now have a more aesthetic look. These are separate locks. Their fixation occurs on each tooth, and in their groove is inserted an arc. It has a shape memory, which contributes to the alignment of teeth. Modern designs are almost invisible. The braces can be ceramic, metal. According to the mechanism of action they are divided into self-limiting, when each lock is closed with a lid, and ligirify when the arc is fixed with elastic bands.<\/li><li>Eliners &#8211; structures for adults, which are transparent removable caps. They change in the process of treatment. As soon as the change takes place and the tooth unfolds, a new version is made. Such mouthguards are individual and are ordered in the laboratory after a complete diagnosis of the patient.<\/li><li>Removable orthodontic plates &#8211; used in children. They consist of a base that is located on the inner surface of the sky or from the lingual surfaces in the case of the lower jaw, and arches that are on top of the teeth. These plates are aimed at correcting the growth of the jaws.<\/li><li>Trainers &#8211; orthodontic device designed for children. Externally, it looks like a boxing mouthpiece. The advantages of this option: it stimulates the growth of the jaw, removes unnecessary myofunctional tension of the cheeks. Also, when the circular mouth muscle is relaxed and the child breathes with his mouth, the mouth guard allows to eliminate this, which is extremely important in orthodontics.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To detect a problem in time, you should visit a specialist regularly.
