<p>In dentistry, as in any other branch of medicine, there are <strong>interesting clinical cases that are </strong>solved by qualified doctors. The publication of such information allows a wide audience to learn about possible problems with the teeth and the methods used to eliminate defects.</p>



<p>As an example, let us consider one case. A woman in her 60s went to a doctor with the diagnosis of &#8220;severe upper and lower jaw atrophy&#8221;. She was fitted with a removable prosthesis. To minimize the problem, the doctors used quality implants. For the lower jaw, they used the All-on-4 treatment concept &#8211; on the day of treatment, a removable prosthesis was fitted, and after a few months, it had to be replaced with a permanent prosthesis. Bridge-shaped prostheses mounted on implants on both jaws were used as a permanent construction.</p>



<p>At the age of 5 years, 12 teeth were found to be affected by decompensated caries. The treatment had to be carried out as soon as possible &#8211; nitrogen-oxygenation oxide was used for this purpose. The restoration of teeth was carried out using composite restoration and crowns.</p>



<p>There are also more complicated cases. Congenital absence of several anterior teeth caused a typical occlusal disorder. Due to the pronounced ectodermal dysplasia and atrophy of the alveolar process, the frontal area needed to be restored. The solution was as follows &#8211; six implants were placed using a surgical template and NobelClinician. Abutments were used, which served as a support for the construction with selected screw fixation.</p>

<p>Endodontics is a science that studies anatomy, possible pathologies and methods of tooth root canals treatment. Doctors find problems and changes in pulp, periodontium. Inflammation in the pulp and surrounding tissues brings many troubles and painful sensations, so patients should visit the dentist on time to prevent the development of chronic disease.</p>



<p>In this article, you will learn more about <strong>endodontics or the animal&#8217;s root canals.</strong></p>



<p>The purpose of endodontic treatment is to preserve the tooth. A simpler alternative is to remove teeth. Endodontist:</p>



<ul><li>will find and eliminate the source of infection;</li><li>will remove the tissues on which caries were found;</li><li>will protect the inside of the tooth.</li></ul>



<p>One of the most famous procedures is root canal treatment. This is the anatomical space inside the root of the tooth. Before the procedure, local anesthesia is performed. Then, measures can be taken to treat the pulpitis or periodontitis, depending on the problem the patient is dealing with. After that, the affected areas of tissue and pulp are removed. The pulp chamber and root canals are cleaned and disinfected.</p>



<p>The doctor will completely eliminate the infection before beginning to fill the root canals of the gutta-percha &#8211; a special material that can provide a seal. It is non-toxic and has good biocompatibility. The final stage is the filling of the pulp cavity.</p>



<p>When the problem is corrected, the tooth must be restored. For this purpose, either a filling is used or pins and crowns are used &#8211; everything depends on the volume of the affected tissue. Special pins allow you to restore the crown part of the tooth, which ensures the preservation of the treatment result for a long time.</p>

<p>Oral hygiene determines the future health of your teeth. To protect yourself from various unpleasant things, such as visible plaque, tartar deposits, tooth decay and bad breath caused by decomposing food and bacteria, you need regular care.</p>



<p>If the plaque is not cleaned properly, it will be converted to tartar. It is impossible to remove it at home. Therefore, a professional cleaning is required, which involves an examination, identification of problems, and a gradual cleaning. It should be done twice a year, but this standard may vary from individual to individual. People with crowns or braces need professional care every 4 months. If you smoke or have a strong interest in coffee, it is recommended that you take the procedure every 3 months.</p>



<p>Preventing illness is always much easier than curing, so home oral care should be mandatory and regular. We have collected several recommendations:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>The toothbrush must be selected individually, it all depends on the sensitivity and condition of your teeth.</li><li>The cleaning process should be thorough and take at least 3 minutes.</li><li>Remove plaque from your tongue with a ribbed rubber surface on the brush;</li><li>You should also brush your teeth after meals. If there is no time or opportunity to do so, rinse your mouth with water.</li><li>A brush may not always be able to remove food between the teeth, so floss.</li><li>To clean each interdental space, you need to thread about 5 times.</li><li>After the procedure, use a rinse to remove the remaining food, get rid of bacteria in the mouth, strengthen the enamel, prolong breath freshness and keep teeth whiter.</li></ol>



<p>The modern irrigation device will help in the careful care of your teeth. It is similar to a brush, but instead of its head there is a thin tube from which the liquid is supplied under pressure. With the help of an irrigator, you can clean hard-to-reach places and get rid of plaque. It has a massage effect on the gums, is suitable for the care of braces and crowns, disinfects the oral cavity.</p>



<p>All products should be selected individually upon doctor&#8217;s recommendation &#8211; from toothbrush to rinse aid. The necessary cleanliness of the oral cavity supports <strong>home and professional hygiene</strong>. Timely and complete care helps to preserve the health of the tooth rows and periodontium, reduce the possibility of dental diseases.</p>

<p>The <strong>history of dentistry </strong>dates back to the Neolithic Age and is considered an ancient science. Diseases of teeth were actively interested in Egypt and Ancient Rome. The most famous for his research is the ancient Greek healer Hippocrates. Its method of reducing the dislocation of the lower jaw is still in use today.</p>



<p>The first tools to remove teeth in the form of forceps appeared in the 4th century BC. After 5 centuries, jewelers were actively engaged in the production of prostheses, and in the 10th century already had the first attempts to insert teeth.</p>



<p>The founder of scientific dentistry is Foshar. He proposed a method of caries treatment with tin foil, gold, lead. Then came the crowns.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the 19th century, the first manual machine for the treatment of sick teeth was invented, and already in the 20<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;century, dentistry advanced much further in its development. New instruments, materials and medicines for dental treatment appeared. Dental institutes were becoming more and more.</p>



<p>Modern dentistry has developed dental implantation and found ways to restore damaged tissues. Nowadays, research in the field of growing teeth in the place of the lost ones is being conducted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interesting facts</strong></h2>



<p>Dentistry is a fascinating science. Its rapid development opens new facts about the oral cavity:</p>



<ul><li>The hardest material in the human body is enamel;</li><li>The toothbrush covers 60% of the tooth surface, so additional flossing is required;</li><li>The language has the same unique imprint as the fingers;</li><li>Unbalanced and low-calorie diets promote tooth decay and inflammatory processes;</li><li>Soda lovers have 62% more seals;</li><li>On average, a person spends 39 days brushing their teeth in their entire life;</li><li>The sweetener, which is used in toothpastes, is 500 times sweeter than sugar;</li><li>After recovering from a cold, be sure to change your toothbrush &#8211; there are bacteria on the toothbrush that can cause repeated illness.</li></ul>



<p>Many <strong>interesting facts </strong>serve not only as fascinating information. They make you think and change your constant habits.</p>

<p>Many do not want to go to the dentist even in severe pain. The reason for this is the fear of painful procedures. For comfortable treatment, modern dental clinics offer various options of anesthesia. They depend on the patient&#8217;s pain threshold, duration of treatment, and complexity of the disease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Modern pain relief in dentistry can be of these types:</h3>



<ul type="1"><li>Application anesthesia, or &#8220;freeze&#8221;, is a solution or gel that is applied to the surface of the oral mucosa. It enters the tissue and blocks the nerve impulses. It is used for the removal of milk teeth and before injection.</li><li>For simple manipulations, for example, in the treatment of caries, a shot is given &#8211; it is an infiltration anaesthesia. It affects the nerve peripheral ends.</li><li>Conductive anesthesia is used to cut off several nerve accumulations, channels (during surgical operations).</li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;To prolong the effect of pain relief, add medicines that narrow the blood vessels. Thus, medications are slower to enter the body, and the anesthesia gives a more effective result. Some chronic diseases, allergic reactions make it impossible to apply local anesthesia. These include diseases of the cardiovascular system, diabetes, intolerance of anesthetics or their individual components. To avoid complications and poor health after anesthesia, you should inform your doctor about health problems in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Orthopedic rehabilitation </strong>is a procedure aimed at restoring chewing functions of teeth and the aesthetic appearance of the maxillofacial area. To restore the aesthetic form of the jaw, a complex treatment is necessary. Early prosthetics may be performed using orthopedic structures or implants.</p>



<p>The placement of implants is often carried out in the event of tooth row defects. If the bone tissue remains healthy, the recovery from these measures is much faster. At first glance, it may seem that the presence of an implant does not allow you to maintain the aesthetic appearance of your jaw and teeth, but it is not. The use of modern techniques leads to the creation of beautiful teeth and full preservation of chewing function.</p>



<p>To ensure that the rehabilitation is carried out as efficiently as possible, doctors take care of the choice of suitable materials that will correspond to the natural teeth. Fabricated orthopedic structures will have a long service life and perform their functions perfectly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Orthopedic rehabilitation is also required in the following cases:</h3>



<ul><li>in the absence of one or more teeth, as well as a complete absence of the tooth row;</li><li>if it is necessary, to correct the mutual position of the tooth rows;</li></ul>



<p>Dental rehabilitation allows you to restore the functionality of your jaws and teeth, provided you choose the right method of dissection. Doctors who use suitable impression materials and pay attention to the technique of procedures, restore the original appearance of the tooth rows in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Gum problems are often encountered in both young and adult generation, they lead to the loss of teeth. Inflammatory processes, blood flow disorders in the tissues, the destruction of the supporting apparatus &#8211; the most common gum problems. The main danger of disease lies in the fact that the initial phases may pass without symptoms. For the treatment of tissues surrounding the teeth, is responsible for a direction in dentistry called <strong>periodontics</strong>.</p>



<p>The periodontium includes the gum, bone holes, dental ligaments holding the teeth. Its components are an integral mechanism that performs certain functions: the consolidation of tooth rows, the distribution of chewing load, regulation of chewing muscles, protection against the ingress of pathogens into the deep tissues.</p>



<p>You can recognize the first signs of gum lesions yourself, and then make an appointment to see a periodontist:</p>



<ul><li>Brushing your teeth causes pain, and you notice bleeding gums;</li><li>An unpleasant smell is felt during the day;</li><li>teeth or gums are covered with dark plaque;</li><li>The gums have a swollen appearance;</li><li>hypersensitivity of teeth;</li><li>color change of periodontal tissue;</li><li>Food often gets stuck in the interdental space;</li><li>gum peeling;</li><li>the appearance of pustules in the mouth;</li><li>Tooth mobility is present.</li></ul>



<p>Oral diseases caused by microorganisms in plaque open a direct pathway for bacteria to enter the body, which can provoke other problems. Gum disease leads to the development of stomach ulcers, the formation of micro blood clots, heart problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Periodontal disease prevention</strong></h3>



<p>A healthy <strong>gum and periodontium </strong>is the key to the integrity and strength of teeth, because an attractive smile is an important part of our charm. Following the rules below will help to keep your mouth healthy:</p>



<ul><li>Do not forget to brush twice a day and additionally after each meal;</li><li>Tooth brushing should be thorough and take at least 4 minutes;</li><li>To remove bacteria from the mouth, use a rinse or soda solution (in 200 ml of warm water add 1 teaspoon of salt and soda, 2 drops of pharmacy iodine);</li><li>Where teeth fit tightly, floss to clean the gaps;</li><li>Visit a specialist in time, do not delay with treatment in case of pain or other symptoms;</li><li>Periodically perform a professional cleaning.</li></ul>



<p>It is necessary to visit the periodontist twice a year for prevention. This way you can prevent or detect symptoms of periodontal disease in time and start timely treatment.</p>

<p>There are several methods of dental treatment, which allow you to eliminate problems in the oral cavity. Depending on the condition, the appropriate treatment method is chosen:</p>



<ul type="1"><li>Prosthetics. It allows you to replace your own teeth with a removable or fixed construction called a prosthesis. Modern techniques avoid the removal of the nerve. The pulp is only removed if the tooth is severely damaged by decay. In this case, the tooth is treated and a crown is fitted. If the tooth is &#8220;alive&#8221;. But a lot of hard tissue is lost, then the crown is used for protection. However, the nerve is not removed.</li><li>Implantation. The modern method of dental restoration. The neighbouring teeth are not affected and the prosthesis is fixed directly on the implant. It is possible to fit even in places where there are no healthy teeth. Prostheses on implants last much longer and maintain the aesthetic appearance of the jaw.</li><li>Dental therapy. It is used to eliminate many problems, in particular caries. In order to get the oral cavity in order, you will need to eliminate the existing plaque on the tooth and fill the resulting cavity with filling material. Untimely removal of dental caries results in pulpitis or periodontitis. It is possible to remove the pulp, followed by administration of the drug. It allows to eliminate harmful microorganisms, after which the filling of channels is carried out.</li><li>Orthodontics. Aimed at correcting defects of teeth or deformations of the jaw. Orthodontists use braces, which allow you to keep an even number of teeth, regardless of the age of the patient. And for children with early loss of milk teeth, there are space maintainers. They allow to keep the space needed for further growth of the molar teeth.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Quite often there are problems in the oral cavity, and the problem may not be in the dental system at all. Dentists repeatedly on the basis of examination of the patient can detect signs of disease in endocrinology. The fact is that the formation, development and activity of the human tooth jaw system depends on the endocrine system. As a result, there are many diseases.</p>



<p>So, let&#8217;s consider the main diseases against the background of changes in the endocrine system:</p>



<ul type="1"><li>Tooth enamel erosion. When there is a hormonal failure in the human body, resulting in hyperfunction of the thyroid gland, so-called thyrotoxicosis, the enamel and dentin of the tooth is lost minerals. Symptoms in this case are an increase in saliva secretion with a simultaneous decrease in its viscosity. This is what disrupts the mineral balance of the tooth&#8217;s hard tissue. As a result &#8211; a violation of chewing function, the appearance of the wrong bite, the formation of caries.</li><li>Necrosis of teeth enamel. This disease is also called necrosis. Enamel yellowing occurs, and the teeth become sensitive. This affects the fluctuations in food temperature. The enamel breaks down quickly, as it becomes brittle and broken.
