<p>Many parents believe that if milk teeth fall out sooner or later, you should not worry about them. However, the future of the primary teeth directly depends on the condition of the first ones, as they serve as a foundation, their defects have an adverse effect on the formation of permanent teeth.</p>



<p>Baby&#8217;s first teeth begin to appear at four months and up to three years should form a tooth row. Therefore, the child should be shown to a specialist from the first year of life. The doctor will help to determine your baby&#8217;s bad habits, give recommendations for oral care, prescribe treatment for painful teeth appearance.</p>



<p>At the age of two years should visit the dentist 2-3 times a year. Regular scheduled check-up helps to prevent caries and detect asymptomatic diseases.</p>



<p>From the age of six it is necessary to pay special attention to enamel, the strength of the primary teeth depends on it. During this period begins to form a bite, so regularly inspect the child&#8217;s mouth. If you identify the slightest deviations, contact an orthodontist. Do not delay with a visit to a specialist &#8211; ignoring the problem leads to complications, long and difficult treatment.</p>



<p>Information about <strong>what is important for parents to know about children&#8217;s teeth </strong>will help identify problems in time and properly maintain a child&#8217;s health:</p>



<ul><li>Reduce sugar consumption to a minimum, limit chocolate and sweets;</li><li>Make sure that the child drinks enough water;</li><li>Teach children to brush their teeth daily and correctly;</li><li>Visit a specialist in a timely manner and do not delay the visit when the first complaints appear.</li></ul>



<p>Properly prepare your child for the first trip to the dentistry. Do not create terrible illusions. The fear that arose before the doctor in childhood, will not pass in adulthood. It is better that it was a planned examination, not caused by pain. Then the child will not be afraid of the doctor and will leave with good memories. A pediatric dentist is a kind doctor who knows the psychological techniques and can accommodate any baby.</p>
