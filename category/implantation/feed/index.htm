<p>For the treatment of patients in dentistry, various methods are used, among which the <strong>bone plastic </strong>is very popular. This surgical operation allows increasing the volume of bone tissue. Patient may experience bone atrophy, and plastic surgery allows you to increase the necessary amount of tissue for the placement of implants. The contour of the face will be restored, so the aesthetic component is not necessary to worry about.</p>



<p>Most often, bone grafting is performed when there is not enough bone volume or density to carry out the implantation. After implantation, there is less chance of rejection of the implant. If the bone tissue is not high enough, an operation can also be scheduled.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of operations</strong></h1>



<p>Depending on the problem, the doctor chooses one of the types of bone plastics:</p>



<ul type="1"><li>Sinus-lifting. This operation involves the expansion of the maxillary sinuses with artificial materials &#8211; powders, granules or blocks &#8211; which contribute to the natural repair of damaged tissues.</li><li>Autotransplantation allows you to increase the volume of bone using your own materials &#8211; it may be a bone taken from other areas of the oral cavity.</li><li>Barrier membranes &#8211; in this case a gingival incision is made, which is filled with bone material. Next, the membrane is installed and seams are applied to the existing incision.</li></ul>



<p>The main reason why bone surgery is required is bone atrophy in the area with a missing tooth. But this is not the only problem that leads to the need for surgery. There may also be inflammation with thinning of the bone tissue, tumors, rejection of the implant, the need to remove the tooth.</p>



<p>Before starting the operation, it is necessary to conduct an examination, based on which the most effective <strong>methods of </strong>treatment will be selected. The dentist will be able to choose the best type of plastic surgery, which will help to restore the lack of bone tissue.</p>

<p><strong>The </strong>procedure of placing a prosthesis and crown in place of a lost tooth is called implantation. <strong>New approaches and solutions to the </strong>problem of lost teeth allow the procedure to be performed without roots. Removable dentures are a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Implantation is a painless manipulation in which the crown is fixed on an artificial root. It does not have an adverse effect on health and does not affect other teeth. Externally, it is difficult to distinguish the crown from a natural tooth. The advantage of the crown is the length of service. Qualitatively performed procedure and subsequent care extends the service life of the implant to 35 years.</p>



<p>In the case of tooth loss, it is recommended to start implantation immediately, otherwise you may have disorders:</p>



<ul><li>Tooth movement leads to bite changes, then food will get stuck between the teeth, which causes periodontal disease;</li><li>reduces the quality of food processing and leads to problems in the gastrointestinal system;</li><li>loss of several teeth will lead to changes in facial features and premature wrinkles;</li><li>diction problems.</li></ul>



<p>The implantation of one tooth involves the installation of an artificial root and a crown.</p>



<p>For placement of several teeth in a row, an implant-supported bridge is created. The crowns connected to each other are attached to the implants.</p>



<p>All teeth are restored with a prosthesis. Usually, up to 4 implants are implanted. The prosthesis can be removed if necessary. Supporting the implants places stress on the bone tissue, not the gum.</p>



<p>Implantation has its disadvantages, it is contraindicated to people with poor blood clotting, intolerance to drugs used in implantation, rheumatism, serious cardiovascular disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The newest approaches to dental treatment allow to get quick painless results for a long time. Thanks to the use of single-step techniques, there is no need to wait long for the implants to take root. Just one visit to the dentist is enough, and you will leave with a white smile!</p>
