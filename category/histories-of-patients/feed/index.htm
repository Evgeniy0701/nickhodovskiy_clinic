<p>Marina Traskovskaya: &#8220;She treated teeth of many dentists, but could not find a suitable specialist. Some doctors chose not quite the correct treatment, so it was not possible to bring the oral cavity in order. One day I came to Sergey, who worked at a well-known clinic. He quickly and painlessly cured a complex tooth.</p>



<p>But once the pain in the teeth came back, this time he began to worry about the tooth, which had not been treated before. I had to go back to the dentistry. Sergey did not work in it anymore. The administration of the clinic did not provide the contact number of the specialist, and I refused to go to another doctor. My teeth did not stop hurting, so I had to urgently look for an experienced dentist.</p>



<p>I did not know which clinic to choose, so I decided to look for dentistry on the Internet. A friend sent a link to the family clinic, and looking through the photos, I saw a doctor I knew. Now I know exactly where I can get help. I made an appointment and in a few days I found myself again in Sergey&#8217;s chair, where he quickly relieved me of pain.&#8221;</p>
