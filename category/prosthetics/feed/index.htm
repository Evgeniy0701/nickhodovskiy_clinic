<p>Dentists use many approaches to treat problems in the oral cavity. One of them is <strong>aesthetic rehabilitation</strong>. It allows restoring the function of the tooth, getting rid of painful sensations, while maintaining a pleasant view of the teeth and an attractive smile. Doctors involved in aesthetic dentistry:</p>



<ul><li>tooth decay is treated;</li><li>eliminate gum inflammation;</li><li>fix the bite;</li><li>eliminate gaps between teeth;</li><li>prostheses are fitted;</li><li>restore broken teeth;</li><li>perform professional cleaning;</li><li>install veneers.</li></ul>



<p>Treatment of tooth decay allows not only to return to its original appearance, but also to restore a beautiful smile. The use of modern composite materials, which are invisible, allows you to install fillings. Nobody will guess about their presence. Doctors will get rid of caries and will restore the deformed parts of the tooth that were broken or destroyed.</p>



<p>Inflammation and gum recession do not look too attractive, so timely treatment is necessary &#8211; it will restore the aesthetic look of the mouth cavity. The most common problem is exposure of the tooth roots due to incorrect biting or other mechanical damage. In order to eliminate the negative effects, doctors use surgical methods to return the soft tissues to their place.</p>



<p>Professional tooth brushing provides complete and painless cleaning of the surface of teeth and the areas between them. For this purpose, clean water and abrasives are used, supplied under high pressure. This removes plaque and food residue.</p>



<p>Restoration of teeth with veneers may be necessary in case of darkened tooth enamel and chips, irregular teeth or other deformations. Veneers are porcelain plates of minimal thickness that are fixed to the front surface of the teeth. They make teeth whiter and more aesthetically pleasing.</p>



<p>The installation of veneers also allows you to get rid of diastems &#8211; gaps between teeth. If the gap is too large, the doctor will choose a filling material of the appropriate color and increase the volume of hard tissue on the central teeth, after which the original function and aesthetic appearance will be restored.</p>
